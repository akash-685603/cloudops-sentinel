Flask API: Exposes /health and /metrics endpoints for real-time monitoring.

Metrics Collector: Gathers system metrics using psutil with CI-safe dummy fallbacks.

Alerting: Sends notifications via Slack and email on anomalies.

Scheduler: Automates periodic health checks, metric collection, and alerting.

Log Backup: Securely uploads logs to S3 for auditing and retention.

DevOps Integrations
Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose for consistent, reproducible environments.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions pipeline automates testing, builds, and Trivy security scanning.

Security: Automated vulnerability scans keep deployments production-ready.

Portfolio Ready: End-to-end workflow illustrates cloud monitoring best practices.
