Flask API: Exposes /health and /metrics endpoints for monitoring.

Metrics Collector: Gathers system metrics using psutil, with CI-safe fallbacks.

Alerting: Sends notifications via Slack and email when anomalies are detected.

Scheduler: Automates periodic health checks, metric collection, and alerting.

Log Backup: Uploads logs securely to S3 for auditing and retention.


**DevOps Integrations
**
Containerization: Docker + docker-compose for consistent environments

CI/CD: GitHub Actions pipeline with testing, build automation, and Trivy security scanning

Security: Automated vulnerability scanning ensures production-ready deployments

Portfolio Ready: Demonstrates end-to-end cloud monitoring workflow


**Project Highlights
**
Lightweight Python-based monitoring toolkit for cloud ops

Fully modular and extensible architecture

Integrates monitoring, alerting, backup, and CI/CD in a single project

Perfect for portfolio showcase or LinkedIn demo
